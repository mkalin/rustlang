one or more references (&T) to a resource,
exactly one mutable reference (&mut T).

You may notice that this is very similar, though not exactly the same as, to the definition of a data race:

There is a ‘data race’ when two or more pointers access the same memory location at the same time, where at least one of them is writing, and the operations are not synchronized.
