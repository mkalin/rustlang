 # A Rust program consists of one or more functions, one of which is 'main'.

   ## The function named 'main' is the program's entry point.

   ## Sketch of a sample program:

      fn main() {
         // function's body
      }

      // 1st comes the argument's name, then a colon, and then the data type
      fn foo(arg: i32) { // function takes one argument, returns nothing
         // function's body
      }

      // 1 floating-point arg, returns a floating-point value
      fn bar(num: f32) -> f32 {
         // function's body
      }

      // a function can return multiple values, not just one
      fn baz(num: f32) -> (f32, f32) {
         // function's body
      }

      // the function baz could be called as follows:
      let (n1, n2) = baz(12.3, 3.21);  // n1 binds to the 1st returned value, n2 to the 2nd


   ## The functions can occur in any order in a source file, and a program's
      functions may be distributed among several source files.

 # Functions come in two flavors: regular functions (as sketched above) and
   methods:

     // program slice to illustrate a method
     let array = [1, 2, 3];   // an array of three integers
     for n in array.iter() {  // iter() is an array method for iterating over an array
       println!("{}", n);     // 1, 2, 3
     }

 # All functions can take none or more arguments, and optionally return a value. Although
   Rust has a 'return' statement, the preferred way to return a value is to make the
   appropriate expression the last in a function:

     // using an explicit return statement
     fn sum(n1: i32, n2: i32) -> i32 {
        return n1 + n1;  // return statement: note the semicolon at the end
     }

     // using an expression
     fn sum(n1: i32, n2: i32) -> i32 {
        n1 + n2         // note well: no semicolon
     }
